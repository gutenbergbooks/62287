<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Amateur Journalists Who Became Famous</span></h2>
<p>In &ldquo;The Career and Reminiscences
of an Amateur Journalist,&rdquo;
Thos. G. Harrison states that
Nathaniel Hawthorne was really a
pioneer member of the clan, having
gotten out six weekly issues of
a periodical of this description,
called THE SPECTATOR, the first
number appearing Aug. 21, 1820.
Thus it predates by three years
what many have heretofore accepted
as his first literary effort,
in the SALEM GAZETTE, in 1823.</p>
<p>Prior to its appearance, Hawthorne,
at that time a youth of 16,
got out a preliminary prospectus,
stating that THE SPECTATOR
would be issued on Wednesdays, at
12c per annum, payment to be
made at the end of the year. In an
early issue, Hawthorne advertised
that he proposed to publish by subscription,
a new edition of &ldquo;The
Miseries of Authors,&rdquo; to which he
promised to add a sequel containing
facts and remarks drawn from
his own experience.</p>
<p>Truman J. Spencer, for many
years a historian on amateur
journalism, questions whether a
copy of either THE SPECTATOR
or Hawthorne&rsquo;s prospectus, is in
existence today. Here, then, is an
opportunity for ambitious bibliophiles
and rare book speculators
to ransack the garrets of their ancestors,
and &ldquo;see what they can
see.&rdquo; Harrison states that THE
SPECTATOR was neatly written
by the hand of Hawthorne. It was
probably manifolded by some
crude reproducing process of that
period.</p>

<h3 id="c3">TO THE JUVENILE PUBLIC.</h3>
<p>The title to address the public, when a
periodical work is first offered for patronage,
is established by custom, and a deviation
from the general usage, would be a
breach of decorum, since the public now
demands, as a right, what formerly it
granted as a courtesy; and, of late years,
more labour is bestowed in writing these
&ldquo;<i>Repositories of promises</i>,&rdquo; than in vamping
up the original work. As it seems
required, therefore of every candidate,
that he should publicly declare his pretensions
to favour, the Editor, in compliance
with the general custom, deems it necessary,
briefly to state the intention of the
present work; and, in this, as well as in
his Editorial capacity, in general, he respectfully
solicits from his patrons, that
indulgence, which the inexperience of
youth so amply requires. In order, therefore,
to make up for his own deficiency,
he respectfully solicits the favour and assistance
of such of the &ldquo;<i>Literary Youth</i>,&rdquo;
as may have time and inclination, to favour
him with their communications. He
has, also, the promise of a few gentlemen
of polite taste, to condescend their aid,
&ldquo;to diffuse elegant and instructive literature,
to soothe trembling merit, and to
<span class="smaller">ROUSE AND FOSTER INFANT GENIUS</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The columns of the <span class="sc">Juvenile Port-Folio</span>,
will consist of all the <i>variety of
subject</i>, and Miscellaneous literature,
which Magazines, and other periodical
literary works, usually contain: Selected
with particular attention to those subjects,
that are adapted to the improvement, edification,
and rational amusement of youth.
In our searches after variety, a preference
will always be given to those pieces, which
are characterised by elegance of expression,
chastity of thought, and value of information.
&ldquo;Though we shall touch, like
the Bee, upon every plant in the garden
of literature, we shall only extract from
those which produce sweets, and diffuse
fragrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the more general subjects of literature,
its pages will always be open to
such extracts of popular interest, as may
be judicious and entertaining; also a general
selection of rare anecdotes, points of
wit, brilliant repartee, &amp;c. Our purpose
will be to render this department, lively
without licentiousness, brilliant without tinsel,
and elegant without elaboration.</p>
<p>In the region of the Muses, we particularly
solicit aid, but we fear &ldquo;not from
the voice of inspiration.&rdquo; We may venture,
however, to hope, that the perusal
of our selected poetry will excite emulation,
as no piece will be admitted, which
cannot lay some claim to true genius and
poetical merit.</p>
<p>The Ladies will receive the <span class="sc">Juvenile
Port-Folio</span> as an entertaining companion,
studious of their favour, by courtly
manners and valuable information; and
the Gentlemen will find in it, a manly and
correct conduct, which we hope will not
be unworthy of their regard; as, we shall
ever be anxious to please the Polite, the
Learned, the Witty and the Fair, with
those views, we are emboldened to ask
the patronage of the public.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And, confident of praise, <span class="smaller">IF PRAISE BE DUE</span>,</p>
<p class="t0">Trust without fear, to merit and to You.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But Hawthorne was not the first
to publish a &ldquo;boys&rsquo; paper.&rdquo; From
a pamphlet on &ldquo;Amateur Journalism,&rdquo;
issued by Will G. Snow of
Meriden, Conn., to commemorate
&ldquo;An Association of Amateur Journalists
of the Past,&rdquo; called &ldquo;The
Fossils,&rdquo; we learn that the earliest
known American example is THE
JUVENILE PORTFOLIO AND
LITERARY MISCELLANY, an
eight-page weekly, published from
Oct. 17, 1812 to Dec. 7, 1816 by
Thomas G. Condie, Jr., at 22 Carter&rsquo;s
Alley, opposite Stephen
Girard&rsquo;s Bank, Philadelphia, as per
illustration herewith.</p>
<p>After the demise of Hawthorne&rsquo;s
periodical, amateur journalism
seemingly went into a slumber
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
twice as long as the famed sleep of
Rip Van Winkle. However, in 1858,
came the COOS HERALD of Lancaster,
N. H., and by 1872, approximately
200 amateur gazettes
were being turned out. At this period
the juvenile journal considered
as having the largest circulation,
was OUR BOYS, started in
Chicago in 1871 as a &ldquo;four-pager,&rdquo;
and which by 1873 had evolved into
a 16-page periodical almost as
large as HARPER&rsquo;S WEEKLY. In
its prime it is said to have enjoyed
a circulation of 10,000 copies per
issue. Most of these sheets varied
in size from 4 pages of 3 by 4 inch
dimensions to 32 pages, measuring
10 by 12, the latter about the
width of four ordinary newspaper
columns. The average life of an
amateur paper was estimated at
8 months, which period was ample
to disgust most youthful journalists
with the hardships of an editorial
career.</p>
<p>In 1869, it was deemed advisable
to organize an association for mutual
acquaintance, social intercourse
and to assist the cause of
amateur journalism throughout
the United States. A meeting was
held in New York at the residence
of Charles Scribner, from which
evolved the National Amateur
Press Association. Nellie Williams,
a 13-year miss, is credited as being
the first &ldquo;female of the species.&rdquo;
She issued the PENFIELD
EXTRA soon after the commencement
of the Civil War. It had been
planned to issue an amateur journal
at the Centennial Exposition of
1876, and it was said that $5000
could have been raised without difficulty
for that purpose, but Director
General Goshorn would not
allot space, claiming that the word
&ldquo;amateur&rdquo; savored of infancy of
mind.</p>
<p>When approximately half a century
ago, George Harrison announced
himself as a candidate for
the presidency of the Western
Amateur Press Association, his
ambition did not meet with unanimous
endorsement, if we consider
the following outburst from a rival
sheet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We smelt the smell of a dead
rat when we received a copy of
the WELCOME VISITOR, stating
that Harrison is a candidate
for the position of President of
the Western Amateur Press Association,
against Wyn Morris.
We can inform the gentleman
from Indiana that he is on the
hull of a sinking ship, and when
he grasps for the exalted position
he has in view, it will melt
before his eyes, and he will gradually
sink into the waters of oblivion.
George, dear George, you
are left sure.&rdquo;&mdash;AMATEUR
IOWAN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this not over-delicate prognostication,
the Harrison clan replied
in kind as set forth below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;THE IOWAN no doubt smelt
its own smell, eh. As for Harrison
being left in the race, we
beg to inform our IOWA contemporary,
in all probability it
is entirely mistaken. No other
candidate now in the field has a
better chance than he.&rdquo;&mdash;The
WELCOME VISITOR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us quote one more expression
of opinion, as one contempt-orary
to another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In our estimation nothing is
so contemptible as to publish an
article against an individual and
then refuse to send him a copy
of the paper containing the attack.
The low-lived editors of the
YOUNG DEMOCRAT should
paste this in their hats.&rdquo;&mdash;THE
ACORN, St. Louis.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>At the time Mr. Snow wrote his
&ldquo;Amateur Journalism&rdquo; pamphlet,
in 1922, the Fossil Library, consisting
of 50,000 old amateur papers,
was located at 150 Nassau
St., New York. It has since been
moved to the Franklin Memorial
Institute, Philadelphia, where it
will be permanently preserved under
the care of the Curtis Family
of SATURDAY EVENING POST
fame. The second largest collection
is owned by Truman J. Spencer, of
Hamden, Conn., while Vincent B.
Haggery of Jersey City, N. J., has
one of the very few known files of
the official organ of the National
Amateur Press Association, embracing
63 years. Any one interested
can obtain information as to
other fine collections by writing to
Edwin H. Smith, Librarian of the
N.A.P.A., 524 N. Kenmore St.,
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As to amateur journalists who
subsequently reached exalted
ranks as authors or publishers, Mr.
Spencer has kindly furnished me
with the following list:</p>
<p>FRANK B. NOYES, publisher
Washington STAR, at age of 12
ran the TIMES.</p>
<p>THEODORE BODENWEIN
(recently deceased), publisher of
the New London DAY, at 17 ran
the THAMES BUDGET.</p>
<p>E. H. STAIR, owner Detroit
FREE PRESS, ran OUR BOYS
AND GIRLS, in 1873.</p>
<p>JOSEPHUS DANIELS, publisher
of the Raleigh NEWS AND OBSERVER,
and ex-Secretary of the
Navy, at age of 12 ran the CORNUCOPIA.</p>
<p>RICHARD W. GILDER, for
many years editor of the CENTURY
MAGAZINE, ran the REGISTER
at 16.</p>
<p>CYRUS H. K. CURTIS, S. E.
POST AND LADIES&rsquo; HOME
JOURNAL publisher, conducted
YOUNG AMERICA at the age of
14.</p>
<p>JOHN THAYER, well-remembered
as publisher of EVERYBODY&rsquo;S
MAGAZINE and the
SMART SET, when only 13, ran
the PRINTER.</p>
<p>GEORGE B. M. HARVEY, one
of the final publishers of HARPER&rsquo;S
WEEKLY, issued the
DEMOCRAT when only 14.</p>
<p>There were many other eminent
publishers that lack of space compels
us to omit. And as for authors
who became famous, Robert Louis
Stevenson issued the SUNBEAM
MAGAZINE when 16; Frank
Baum who wrote &ldquo;The Wizard of
Oz&rdquo; published the HOME JOURNAL
in 1868; and Walter Pritchard,
New York theatre critic,
and author of numerous books on
the drama, joined the amateur
ranks at 12.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Spencer, amateur
journalism still exists and
continues to hold a fascination for
many youths of today. From the
speculative standpoint, however,
there is at present no active demand
for an oldtime collection
thereof, although probably some
individual with an ample purse and
a nostalgia for youth, would be
happy to possess one, and pay well
for it. But who and where he is, it
will take a wiser person than the
editor of this publication, to
identify.</p>
<p>Collectors of this interesting
phase of Americana, will look forward
with pleasurable anticipation
to the publication of a book entitled
&ldquo;History of Amateur Journalism,&rdquo;
on which Truman J.
Spencer has been working for
years. The outline of contents will
comprise, DEFINITION AND
DESCRIPTION ... THE PIONEERS

<p>The famous rooming house at
61 Washington Square, N. Y., conducted
for more than fifty years
by Mme. Katherine Branchard,
and since her decease in 1937, by
her daughter-in-law, is no more.
During their years of struggle it
was a haven of repose for Willa
Cather, Frank Norris, Gelett Burgess,
Theodore Dreiser and Adelina
Patti. After their departure
from the Branchard House, which
incidentally is over 100 years old,
they wrote her letters from all
parts of the world, and these
should produce some good autographic
material.</p>
<p>Mrs. Adelaide M. Faron, of the
Walt Whitman Society of America,
and Librarian of the Hempstead
Library, Hempstead, Long
Island, N. Y., recently held at the
Adelphia College, Garden City, N.
Y., an exhibition of rare items and
newly discovered manuscripts pertaining
to the &ldquo;good gray poet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here is a little good advice from
that past master of sheet music
knowledge, Wm. McDevitt, 2079
Sutter St., San Francisco. In his
very entertaining monthly called
BOOK-COLLECTING (50 cents a
year) he says:&mdash;&ldquo;In buying first
editions of old songs, you will be
safer in most cases if the sheet
music doesn&rsquo;t contain ads on the
back cover; you will generally do
well to distrust copies with the
copyright line on front apparently
worn out with repeated printings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large mass of propaganda
from both foreign and domestic
pressure groups is being collected
and classified by the Carnegie Library
of Washington and the
Washington and Lee University
of Lexington, Va.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C., has acquired a
collection of photographs of real
Wild West Indians, made by John
K. Hillers, 66 years ago.</p>

<p>Frequently I am asked, &ldquo;What
is a safe investment in autographic
material over a long period of
years?&rdquo; The answer may well come
from my experience gained in this
field during the past decade. The
boom years of 1928 and 1929 sent
many items of a literary, historical
and musical character sky-rocketing,
although subsequently they
shot down just as suddenly, 1938
seeing prices at probably their
lowest level in 25 years. And yet,
just as in the case of rare books,
some forms of autograph material
suffered less than others. The
knowledge thus gained, helps materially
to light the pathway as to
what is the best sort of autographic
material to consider for future
investment.</p>
<p>Today, the safest buy seems to
be good Presidential letters written
either before or during their
terms of office, preferably the latter.
These letters must have worthwhile
contents. Uninteresting documents
of our Chief Executives
are all too common and sell at
nominal figures. Signers of the
Declaration of Independence and
of the Constitution are also excellent,
that is, if the contents measure
up. In the literary domain,
authors&rsquo; letters about their works
are always sought for, although
prices are more inclined to fluctuate
than on historical items.</p>
<p>Of late, increased interest has
been evinced in the &ldquo;War between
the States,&rdquo; or, as it is called up
North, the Civil War. An added
lure is that prices for this sort of
material, are almost at rock-bottom,
as collectors are just beginning
to wake up to its importance.
The years will see good war letters
of famous Federal and Confederate
Generals go very high. The upward
swing has already begun.</p>
<p>A new field which has sprung up
recently is that of State collections.
The country has heretofore
been too young to care much for
the historical records of individual
localities. But with the development
of the nation, this interest
has steadily grown, and today, all
letters relating to internal politics
of individual states or cities are
being sought, the competition having
a healthy effect upon prices.</p>
<p>Early Mormon material, and
records pertaining to Texas, Michigan,
Colorado, Virginia, California,
etc., are in active demand, thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
enabling the average dealer to
place them without difficulty almost
as fast as received. Furthermore,
whereas a collector may become
discouraged in buying a
complete set of Signers because of
the super-rarity of a few names,
there is little difficulty in obtaining
the two or three Signers belonging
to the collector&rsquo;s home state,
to say nothing of famous Generals,
literary lights, composers, etc.</p>
<p>The one, almost unchanging
code of the collector should be to
buy hand-written letters of good
date, and of unusual, historical, or
otherwise excellent content. Fine
items seem to hold their value
pretty well, even in times of financial
stress, and with the years
should edge upwards in price. Less
desirable items will fluctuate considerably.
To sum up, good autographs
provide the best expectation
for at least a fair dividend on
the money invested. On the other
hand, common items that have
little to recommend them except
cheapness, are almost invariably a
disappointment as far as the hope
of satisfactory returns, are concerned.
There are occasional exceptions
but this rule holds true
98% of the time. In closing, may I
also stress the importance of being
sure that what you purchase is
genuine. Unless you are an expert
yourself, the safest way is to acquire
your pen treasures only
through a dealer on whose reliability
and experience you can absolutely
depend.</p>

</div>
<p>As Flodden W. Heron aptly observed
in a recent issue of the ARGONAUT,
it is estimated by the
Postal Department that one person
out of every fifteen is interested in
stamp collecting. There are over
twenty-five journals issued exclusively
for stamp collectors, and
three hundred and two American
newspapers maintain stamp departments.
In addition sixty-four
radio stations conduct regular
stamp broadcasts. Book collectors
constitute a much smaller group,
and to date there has been no connection
between these two enthusiastic
armies of &ldquo;acquisitioners.&rdquo;
To bring these two groups into
closer cooperation, Mr. Heron recently
suggested to the Pacific
Philatelic Society of San Francisco
the use of postage stamps of
authors as association items for
collected books. Investigation disclosed
that postage stamps had
been issued in honor of nearly one
hundred authors.</p>
<p>He states that the idea occurred
to him when coming into possession
of a Stamp Case, invented by
Lewis Carroll of &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo;
fame. It contained twelve
pockets for stamps of different denominations.
Progressively this
gave birth to the thought of using
stamps as association items in
connection with first editions, artistically
affixing them to fly-leaves,
inside covers, or occasionally
to title pages. Time will increase
the scarcity or rarity of the
stamps, and in some instances, as
with certain bookplates, greatly
enhance the value of the books to
which they are affixed. Of course
we must bear in mind that the
number who collect stamps exceeds
greatly those whose interest is in
rare books. At the same time,
many high school and college students
and other groups, would
like to collect books but cannot afford
the prices of first editions.
However, if postage stamps are
classified as association items,
thousands can buy books not first
editions, but good reading copies.
The inserting of proper stamps,
will permit of book collecting on
an inexpensive scale, because it is
only necessary to watch dates, and
acquire first-day &ldquo;covers&rdquo; for
merely the regular price of the
stamps. And as time goes on, these
first issues will have increased
value for book insertion, quite
aside from their desirability to
stamp collectors. For example, a
copy of &ldquo;Leaves of Grass,&rdquo; issued
by the Modern Library, with a
first-day Whitman &ldquo;cover&rdquo; laid in,
should fetch over double the cost
of the book within a year after the
stamp was issued. And this, in
spite of the fact that a postage
stamp in connection with a book
can not be compared with an
author&rsquo;s inscription or presentation.
It can be more likened to a
bookplate, which has been added
to the volume by some one other
than the author. Two of Mr. Heron&rsquo;s
favorite authors are Lewis
Carroll and Sir Walter Scott, and
as he could find of them no existing
postage stamps, he had two
made, for his personal use, which
serve as illustrations for this article.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
We feel certain that Mr.
Heron will be glad to answer any
question pertaining to book
stamps on the part of those interested,
if they will address their inquiries
to him at Mills Building,
San Francisco.</p>

<p>Temple Scott, rare book expert,
died on Sept. 30th. in Edinburgh.
Among his many activities, he had
been adviser in the assembling of
some of the notable private libraries
of this country, including
those of Jerome Kern, and the late
William H. Woodin, former Secretary
of the Treasury. The Kern
collection was considered one of
the most valuable ever gotten together
in America, and in 1929
was sold at auction for $1,300,000.
Also remembered are some of Mr.
Scott&rsquo;s outstanding purchases including
the letters of Lord Chesterfield
for which he paid $75,000,
and the original text which Sir
Walter Scott prepared for a definitive
edition of his novels, and
which set him back $150,000.</p>
<p>The first volume of Dr. Greg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Bibliography of the English
Drama to 1640&rdquo; is reported as
ready. Information regarding it
can be obtained from R. B. McKerrow,
Picket Place, Wendover,
Bucks, England.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nellie Dumont, widow of
the minstrel king, Frank Dumont,
died several months ago at her
home, 1207 Green St., Philadelphia,
Penna., where she had resided
for 60 years. Mr. Dumont in
his lifetime, possessed an unusually
fine collection of theatrical
material, and to this day, as far
as we know, it has never been
definitely established, just what
became of it.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Stick &rsquo;Em Up</span></h2>
<p>As a preface to &ldquo;Books on Western
Gunmen,&rdquo; by Guy J. Giffen, in
the Quarterly NEWS-LETTER of
the Book Club of California, an
editorial note states that not the
least interesting subdivision of
Americana is that relating to the
bandits and gunmen of the Old
West. The extensive literature on
the subject offers a tempting field
to collectors with a taste for the
history and legend surrounding
this phase of the Winning of the
West. Mr. Giffen&rsquo;s extensive library
of books on Western outlaws
is the result of a hobby of years&rsquo;
standing.</p>
<p>Mr. Giffen&rsquo;s article maintains
that any well-rounded collection
of Western Americana should have
a division of books on gunmen,
and mentions a number of men and
titles that will serve as a general
guide to their selection. Of particular
interest are the books on Murrieta.
&ldquo;Joaquin Murrieta, the Brigand
Chief of California&rdquo; was published
by the CALIFORNIA POLICE
GAZETTE in 1854, and is
now very rare, only two copies being
known, both in private collections.
According to Franklin Walker
as set forth in &ldquo;San Francisco&rsquo;s
Literary Frontier,&rdquo; John Rollin
Ridge, partly of Indian blood, who
came to San Francisco in 1850,
furnished the GAZETTE with
much of its source material when
he wrote &ldquo;The Life and Adventures
of Joaquin Murrieta, the
Celebrated California Bandit.&rdquo; In
1859, the GAZETTE reprinted the
story with additions but also in
this instance, only two copies are
known to have survived. Of the
many later treatments of Murrieta,
one of the best is &ldquo;The Life
and Adventures of the Celebrated
Bandit Joaquin Murrieta,&rdquo; translated
from the Spanish of Ireno
Paz, by Frances P. Belle. (Chicago,
1925).</p>

<p>This is a readable account of his
exploits, but it credits him with
superhuman ability, and relates incidents
that could not have happened.
In Mr. Giffen&rsquo;s belief, Murrieta&rsquo;s
true history has not yet
been told and at this late date, it
is unlikely that it ever will be. It
may be interesting to collectors of
Murrietana, to note that in 1880,
a play was produced at the Adelphi
Variety Theatre, San Francisco,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
purporting to picture the life of
Murrieta. It was called &ldquo;The
Scarlet IX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stories of two California bandits
of a much later date, Evans and
Sontag, are related in &ldquo;The 25th
Man&rdquo;, published in 1924. The author,
Ed Morrell, gives a readable
account of his experiences with
these outlaws, bearing however a
bit heavily on the first person. The
exploits of Evans and Sontag were
also offered to the public in dramatic
form, at the National Theatre,
San Francisco, in the early
nineties, some of the bandit&rsquo;s children
having been engaged as a sort
of &ldquo;added attraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>C. B. Glasscock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bandits and
the Southern Pacific&rdquo; (New York,
1929) is also an interesting narrative.
&ldquo;Old Waybills&rdquo;, by Alvin F.
Harlow (New York, 1934) while
primarily concerned with the
pioneer express companies, gives
entertaining accounts of Black
Bart, Jesse and Frank James, Sam
Bass and the Daltons, and indicates
a sincere effort to gather the
facts. The books of Owen P.
White have added much to present-day
popular knowledge of the
outstanding killers and peace officers
of the Old West. His &ldquo;Them
Was the Days&rdquo; (New York, 1925),
&ldquo;Trigger Fingers&rdquo; (New York,
1926), and &ldquo;Lead and Likker&rdquo;
(New York, 1932) make exciting
reading and present a true picture
so far as the truth can now be
known. &ldquo;Triggernometry&rdquo; by Eugene
Cunningham (New York,
1935) is another sincere endeavor
to treat the gunmen as human beings
rather than supermen.</p>
<p>Returning to books about individual
bandits, one of the best is
&ldquo;Wild Bill Hickok&mdash;Prince of
Pistoleers&rdquo;, by Frank J. Wilstach
(New York, 1928), this work also
containing many illustrations of
more than passing interest. &ldquo;Wild
Bill&rdquo; (James Butler) Hickok has
been much written about. Probably
the best account of his connection
with the famous McCanlas
affair was published in the NEBRASKA
HISTORY MAGAZINE
for April-June, 1927. In it, the
story of Colonel Nichols, published
previously in HARPER&rsquo;S MAGAZINE
of February, 1867 (and
copied practically by every biographer
of Hickok) is disproved.</p>
<p>Of nineteen volumes dealing with
the James gang, &ldquo;The Rise and
Fall of Jesse James,&rdquo; by Robertus
Love (New York, 1925) seems the
most thorough and unbiased biography.
An important and scarce
James item is &ldquo;The Trial of Frank
James for Murder,&rdquo; by George Miller,
Jr., privately printed in Missouri
in 1898. It gives in detail information
not to be found elsewhere.
The list could go on indefinitely,
for the period of the gunmen
extended from the Civil War
to the middle 90&rsquo;s, and the literature
on the subject is limitless.
Much of it, of course, is lurid, sensational
material, written solely
for entertainment and with no
claim to historical accuracy. But
there are also many more pretentious
works: good, bad and indifferent.
Many otherwise excellent
biographies of Western gunmen
are marred by the fact that the
author&rsquo;s treatment is colored by
his admiration or contempt for his
subject. But, perhaps, that is a
failing of biographers in general.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">INCUNABULA</span></h2>
<p>In a recent article in the New
York TIMES, Philip Brooks, noted
rare book commentator, remarked
that there is nothing particularly
mysterious about incunabula. A
polysyllabic Latin word with an
impressive sound, it means simply
cradle books, or books published
during the infancy of printing.
They occupy only a short span in
the history of books, no more than
about fifty years, from the middle
to the end of the fifteenth century.
To many collectors they are the
true aristocrats, not only for their
antiquity, but often for their artistic
beauty. For nearly 500 years
printers have been trying but none
have been able to approach the
typographical perfection of the
Gutenberg Bible, which was finished
around 1455. Even the paper
of these ancients is of superior
quality that they will outlive most
books issued today.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks further declared
that while a common objection to
collecting incunabula is that they
are incomprehensible, being printed
in dead languages that nobody
reads nowadays, it is nevertheless
a fact that before the end of the
century, books were being published
freely in the vernacular,
and Caxton and his successors
were making valuable contributions
to English literature in their
native tongue.</p>
<p>Since the middle of the seventeenth
century, when the output of
the fifteenth century first began to
attract notice as collectible objects,
they have been subject to
such intensive scrutiny that they
are now the most thoroughly
bibliographed books in the world.
From Panzer (1793-1803) and
Hain (1826-1834), who described
16,300 titles, the scientific study

<p>Moreover, collectors today who
look somewhat wistfully on the
mounting prices of fifteenth century
editiones principes (which
means first editions) of Gutenberg
Bibles even in single leaves, or of
that familiar favorite, the Nuremberg
Chronicle, are probably unaware
that many incunabula are
still available for much less than
$100. The elusiveness and high
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
price of all incunabula are as much
a fiction as the belief that it is impossible
to identify individual volumes.</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that
there are in existence some 40,000
separate editions of books published
during the fifteenth century. No
one has yet had the hardihood to
attempt to count all the known
copies of these editions. One of
the best modern efforts to gauge
their extent was that of K. W.
Hiersemann in his &ldquo;Verlagskatalog&rdquo;,
Leipzig, 1924. He estimated
that there were at least 450,000
pieces of incunabula around, or an
average of more than eleven copies
of each known edition.</p>
<p>In undertaking to investigate
the present-day holdings of incunabula
in all countries, Fremont
Rider, librarian of the Olin Library
at Wesleyan University, reported
that Germany, the birthplace
of printing and native home
of most incunabula, is still, according
to the latest available records,
the largest holder of such
books. With 105 libraries owning
a hundred volumes or more, it
registers a total of 115,927 volumes.
Italy ranks second with
70,721. France makes a poor
third with 35,278, just nosing out
Great Britain&rsquo;s 34,045. Austria
comes next, outranking the United
States, which can muster 22,166
volumes. Poland, Switzerland,
Czecho-Slovakia, Spain, Holland
and Russia follow next in order. In
the 25 countries listed with libraries
of a hundred or more volumes,
Mr. Rider has located 380,750
titles.</p>
<p>The outstanding single collection
of incunabula is in the Bayerische
Staatsbibliothek at Munich,
with its 16,000 volumes. The British
Museum comes second with
11,500, the Bibliotheque Nationale
third with 10,000. The Huntington
Library&rsquo;s 5,200 take sixth
place, while the 3,600 in the Library
of Congress entitle it to
rank seventeenth among the libraries
of the world. Despite the
great influx of incunabula into this
country in recent years, the resources
of the European collections
are incomparable. It is perfectly
true that most American
libraries regard the acquisition of
a single incunabulum as a rare
treasure, while many unheard-of
European libraries of religious orders
or princely families own far
more volumes than our largest and
richest universities.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. Rider&rsquo;s analysis makes no
attempt to assay the contents of
the various collections, as his concern
is only with a quantitative
analysis. Some of the scarcest and
most important incunables have
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
found their way into this country.
As a result of an inquiry among
the 236 most likely sources in the
United States, a table is shown
giving the relative sizes of incunabula
collections in twelve institutions
and over a hundred colleges
and universities. Following the
Huntington and the Library of
Congress are Harvard University
with 1,860 volumes, the Pierpont
Morgan Library with 1,800 and
the Newberry Library with 1,634.
The Folger Shakespeare Library
contains a surprisingly large
Shakespearean ancestry of 250
fifteenth century sources. The
summary leaves out of account the
growing private collections, confined
mostly to this country, whose
numbers should materially affect
the figures and perhaps the order
of rank. Otherwise it gives a satisfactory
account of the distribution
of incunabula in public institutions.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Collecting Medical Literature</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>An Interview With An Authority</i></p>
<p>Hello, Henry Schuman.</p>
<p>Hello, James Madison.</p>
<p>Since moving from Detroit to
730 Fifth Avenue, New York, are
you continuing to make a specialty
of medical rarities?</p>
<p>Yes indeed, in fact more so than
ever.</p>
<p>What class of collectors go in
for medical books?</p>
<p>Mostly members of the medical
profession, but also general collectors
along scientific lines of which
medicine is an integral part.</p>
<p>Do collectors of medical literature
aim to cover the entire field?</p>
<p>Not in most instances. They
usually specialize in branches that
encompass their special interests,
such for example as physiognomy,
transfusion of blood, heart disorders,
venereal ailments, etc.</p>
<p>Has a well-selected medical library
that was already assembled
at say the turn of the century, increased
or diminished in value?</p>
<p>Increased I should say, or,
from a very conservative estimate,
at least held its own. This is due,
no doubt, to the permanent interest
such a medical library holds.
On the other hand, authors of
literary classics, especially from
the beginning of the 19th century
on, are subject to increasing or
waning interest due to a change of
popular favor and appreciation. In
the case of modern authors such
as Hemingway, Faulkner, etc., this
is even more noticeable. The
&ldquo;white-headed&rdquo; literary lion of today
may be on tomorrow&rsquo;s bargain
shelf, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Is the number of collectors of
medical literature increasing?</p>
<p>Somewhat, I should say. In the
late twenties, Dr. Henry E. Sigerist
became head of the Institute of
Medicine at John Hopkins University
where his outstanding accomplishments,
combined also
with his splendid achievement in
promoting the Bulletin of the History
of Medicine, did much to
stimulate new interest, especially
among the younger men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Which is the best medical bibliography?</p>
<p>Probably the best, and certainly
the most concise is Garrison&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Medicine&rdquo;, first published
in 1914 by W. B. Saunders
Co., Philadelphia. The fourth edition
was issued in 1929 and is revised
and comparatively up to
date. It sells for $14.</p>
<p>How can one get posted on the
prices of medical literature?</p>
<p>The Sanders Price List of Medica
Incunabula gives some prices of
early medicine. The cost is $10.
As far as more modern medical
books and miscellany are concerned,
I believe the best guide is dealers&rsquo;
lists who specialize in this sort
of thing. I myself get out occasional
catalogues of medical rarities,
my latest one being issued to
honor the seventieth birthday of
Dr. Harvey Cushing, who is since
deceased.</p>
<p>How do you procure the medical
material that you resell?</p>
<p>There is no royal path that a
dealer can pursue. One source is
medical libraries privately owned,
and which on the decease of the
owner, have come into the possession
of heirs who have no special
interest therein, and who therefore
are not adverse to turning them
into ready cash. Europe, which
may be termed the cradle of old
medicine, holds most of the rarities,
especially those of ancient
vintage, and my correspondents on
the other side are constantly on
the watch for me.</p>
<p>How highly are medical periodicals
regarded by collectors?</p>
<p>They play, as a rule, &lsquo;second
fiddle&rsquo; to books and pamphlets.
They are quite bulky, and in harmony
with the modern scheme of
architectural contraction, collectors
are not inclined to grant them
shelf room. The best modern outlet
for medical periodicals appears
to be colleges and universities, although
in many instances, the seller
pro tem is apt to be met with
the rubber-stamp response of &ldquo;Insufficient
funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have many facsimile reproductions
been made of rare medical
books and pamphlets?</p>
<p>Only a negligible number thus
far and which have sold rather indifferently.
However, with the increasing
interest displayed in the
collecting of medical literature,
facsimiles will come more and
more into their own.</p>
<p>Are many medical works sold at
book auctions?</p>
<p>Hardly any, I should say.
Medical books at best interest but
a modest pro rata of collectors.
Therefore, except in occasional instances,
it has not been found
profitable to include them in auction
catalogues.</p>
<p>Who are the modern American
trail blazers as far as stimulating
interest in the collecting of medical
literature is concerned?</p>
<p>In my opinion, Drs. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, William Osler, and
Harvey Cushing.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>A New Aid to Collectors</i></span></h2>
<p>Early in the year, the Pinwheel Press, of 142 So. 11th St., Philadelphia,

<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>About The New York Mirror</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1823, George P. Morris in
conjunction with Samuel Woodworth
established the New York
MIRROR. In those days Woodworth
was considered quite a poet,
his most permanent obeisance to
the muse being &ldquo;The Bucket&rdquo;, later
more fittingly known as &ldquo;The Old
Oaken Bucket&rdquo;. The MIRROR lasted
until 1842, but returned from
its journalistic grave the year following
and was known as the NEW
MIRROR. It ran for a year and a
half and stated in its last issue in
Sept., 1844, that it was being discontinued
because the Post Office
charged it magazine postage which
was much higher than that required
of newspapers. Perhaps, to
avail itself of this discrimination,
it became a daily about this time,
a weekly edition being gotten out
for the benefit of the former NEW
MIRROR subscribers. From Sept.,
1844 to February, 1845, Edgar
Allan Poe, so the &ldquo;Papers of the
Bibliographical Society of America&rdquo;
reports, was employed as
critical writer. Perhaps this explains
why &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo; was
printed in the EVENING MIRROR,
on Jan. 29, 1845, &ldquo;by permission&rdquo;,
from the advance sheets of
the AMERICAN REVIEW where
it appeared a few weeks later.
While the MIRROR copy is usually
spoken of as the second appearance
of &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;, most collectors
prefer it to its AMERICAN
REVIEW appearance and it commands
a higher price, although in
neither case as much as one might
conjecture.</p>
<p>After Willis and Morris withdrew
in 1845, Hiram Fuller took
charge and with certain minor
changes of title, the periodical
continued until 1857. Soon after
Fuller came into control, he was
sued by Poe for having published
the Thomas Dunn English article
reflecting on his character. Poe
was awarded $225 damages.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>Suckers&rsquo; Progress</i></span></h2>
<p>A book jobber recently found on
his hands an entire warehouse full
of obsolete histories in sets of
20 volumes each. They simply
wouldn&rsquo;t sell; nobody wanted to
give them away as premiums;
their stock was so inferior that
secondhand paper dealers laughed
at the idea of purchasing them.
Then inspiration came to the jobber.
He expressed the entire edition
to a publisher&rsquo;s sucker list,
accompanied by the following
letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>:</p>
<p>We are forwarding you
herewith a set of Professor
McFeely&rsquo;s <i>History of the
World From Earliest Times
Down to the Inaugural of
Chester A. Arthur</i>. There are
two bindings available: one in
cloth such as we are sending
you, retailing for $19.25, the
other in beautiful hand-tooled
crushed levant, for $39.98. If
you should decide you prefer
the expensive leather-bound
edition you may return the
set we are sending you and
upon remitting the balance
you will receive the other
magnificent volumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each sucker actually received
the leather-bound edition&mdash;in fact,
no cloth one existed. But every
recipient, imagining that he had
received the wrong books by mistake
and was gypping the jobber,
sent on his $19.25 and kept the
books. In no time the entire edition
was sold out. (Lucius Beebe in
New York HERALD TRIBUNE
and reprinted by READER&rsquo;S
DIGEST).</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>The New York TIMES reports
that a new Medical Library building
is being erected at the Yale
University of Medicine to receive
Dr. Cushing&rsquo;s library and collections,
including his letters, diaries
and manuscripts. Any of his
friends who wish, now or later, to
present correspondence, photographs
or other memorabilia for
permanent preservation among the
Cushing papers will receive the appreciative
thanks of the university.</p>
<p>The late Merle Johnson, in his
&ldquo;American First Editions&rdquo; called
attention to the fact that there is
no formal Bibliography of the
writings of Bret Harte. The collector
is referred to the sales catalogue
of the Charles Meeker Kozlay
sale, held at the galleries of
the American Art Association
some years ago and now on file at

<p>In &ldquo;San Francisco&rsquo;s Literary
Frontiers&rdquo;, by Franklin Walker,
&ldquo;The Annals of San Francisco&rdquo; is
described as being probably the
best book ever written about that
glamorous city. Its 800 pages give
not only the history of California
during the Spanish and American
occupations, but also a faithful
account of its social history from
1846 to 1854. Included also are
vigorously penned descriptions of
special local happenings, such as
the Great Fires, Steamer Days,
the lawless ravages of The
&ldquo;Hounds&rdquo;, etc, to say nothing of
short biographies of outstanding
oldtimers. The &ldquo;Annals&rdquo; have long
been out of print, but the book was
gotten up so sumptuously that
many copies were kept. It can usually
be picked up for from $7.50 to
$20.00 depending on the condition
and binding. A folding map should
accompany it. A few years ago,
the California Historical Society,
San Francisco, compiled, under
the direction of Charles Francis
Griffin, a 28 page index, which is

1700-1800&rdquo;, and will be
based upon material now housed
in the principal libraries of this
country. It will contain all eighteenth
century historical material
relating to the Western hemisphere,
except newspapers, broadsides,
maps, prints, almanacs,
legislative and administrative proceedings
and statute laws. A preliminary
survey has disclosed that
only about half of the existing
material is recorded in either Sabin
or Evans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-Three Books, and the Stories Behind Them&rdquo; is the title
of John T. Winterich&rsquo;s latest volume, and conveys in its title but meagerly
the feast in store for those who wish to get a new slant on a number
of the world&rsquo;s most famous books and the literary geniuses who wrote
them. Not only has Mr. Winterich an almost unique research aptitude,
but also the magnetic quality of being able to marshal his facts in a
sprightly manner. Aside from this, the book has additionally, a fund of
definite information for collectors, respecting the rarity and speculative
possibilities of the many classics of literature that it deals with. It is
a handsomely bound, fully indexed volume of 241 pages and is published
by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., at $2.50.</p>

<p>The United States Card Collectors&rsquo; Catalog will come as a boon to

cards, post cards, name cards and other non-insert types, tobacco albums,
etc. &ldquo;A pip,&rdquo; &ldquo;An admirable piece of research,&rdquo; &ldquo;A remarkable
feat&rdquo; are a few expressions of opinion from those who possess a copy.
Over three years of preparation were required to compile this 90-page
volume. It sells for 50c, and is published by J. R. Burdick, 417 South

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">Prophets and Profits</span></h2>
<p>Some volumes, for which the
demand was indeed slender several
generations ago, are today the real
prizes of literature. Take for example
the earlier pamphlets and
books of Poe, which today are virtually
beyond the means of the
average collector. But this circumstance
need not stifle collecting
enthusiasm. There are other
volumes, which, while no longer
cheap in terms of dollars and
cents, should nevertheless double
or treble in value, or perhaps even
better than that, as time goes on.
Of course it would be foolish to
promise this as a certainty, and we
shall therefore content ourselves
with pointing out some &ldquo;first edition
nuggets&rdquo; that seem to have
an excellent chance of &ldquo;coming
into the money&rdquo; at some future
period. But before doing so, let
us whisper in your ear, the desirability&mdash;we
might almost say the
necessity&mdash;of only acquiring
&ldquo;firsts&rdquo; in fine condition. Yes, we
know they&rsquo;re hard to get, and also
that they cost more, but in our
opinion, they&rsquo;re well worth the
difference. Auction records have
demonstrated this time and time
again. And now, let us &ldquo;amble beyond
our preamble,&rdquo; and point out
a few, present-day good buys.</p>
<p>Were we going into this branch
of literary speculation, we should
endeavor to acquire the first edition,
first issue of Walt Whitman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Leaves of Grass,&rdquo; and which was
published in Brooklyn, N. Y., in
1855. No need to specify here all
the necessary &ldquo;points,&rdquo; because,
unless you are a 100% bibliophile,
you will probably do better acquiring
this treasure through some
trustworthy and sophisticated rare
book dealer. In his worthy volume,
&ldquo;The Romance of Great
Books and Their Authors,&rdquo; John
T. Winterich quotes an assertion
made by A. Edward Newton to
the effect that the first edition of
the &ldquo;Leaves of Grass&rdquo; will reach
a higher figure than any other important
book published in the nineteenth
century. When this declaration
was made in 1924, asserts Mr.
Winterich, &ldquo;Leaves of Grass&rdquo; was
selling in the market for $200 or
less. Three years later a copy
was auctioned for $800, and in the
interval since, the price has risen,
at auction and rare booksellers&rsquo;
catalogues, to as high as $3,000,
with no indication that a summit
of value has been reached. The
Chaucer Head Bookshop, of New
York, recently offered a fine copy
without foxing for $1,000.</p>
<p>Another book with a definite
speculative future is the first issue
of the first edition of Mark
Twain&rsquo;s first book, &ldquo;The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County, and Other Sketches&rdquo;, with
the original blue cloth binding,
and all the &ldquo;points&rdquo;. It was published
in New York in 1867, and
at the Effrem Zimbalist sale, held
at the Parke-Bernet Galleries on
Nov. 15, an immaculate copy
brought $610. Beadle, the daddy
of lurid American literature on a
large scale, had previously published
in No. 3 of his &ldquo;Dime Book
of Fun&rdquo; an abridged version of the
&ldquo;Frog&rdquo;. And if you should happen
to run across a copy in good
condition, there should be no difficulty
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
in collecting at least $200
therefore.</p>
<p>Or if pocket-book limitations do
not justify &ldquo;eating quite so high
on the hog&rdquo;, we commend the issues
of HARPER&rsquo;S MAGAZINE
from January to August, 1894 inclusive.
These contain the first
printing of George Du Maurier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Trilby&rdquo;. It was later published
in book form, but a picture and a
paragraph, which J. McNeil Whistler
claimed lampooned him, were
omitted from the latter, although
they had appeared in the magazine,
which explains why it is more
sought after by collectors than
the book.</p>
<p>Bound volumes of the Du
Maurier HARPER&rsquo;S without the
covers are not particularly scarce
and hardly to be considered from
the standpoint of a speculative
future. Therefore, endeavor to
secure the unbound monthly parts
in good condition, and with the
original wrappers. At the William
Harris Arnold sale in 1924, they
brought $70.</p>

<p>Thomas J. Condie, Jr., credited by Will Snow with being the earliest
known publisher of an American amateur periodical, came naturally by
his talents. According to Mott&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of American Magazines,&rdquo; his
father Thomas Condie conducted at the tail end of the 18th century, the
PHILADELPHIA MONTHLY, which in 1798 had almost reached the
thousand mark in circulation. Incidentally on page 101 of Goodspeed&rsquo;s
very interesting house-organ, THE MONTH, (December) appears an
aquatint of Girard&rsquo;s Bank which is held at $35. The first article in this
issue speaks of Condie, Jr. having gotten out his JUVENILE PORTFOLIO
AND LITERARY MISCELLANY at 22 Carter&rsquo;s Alley, directly
opposite and the acquatint apparently shows the very building.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small"><i>How To Tell A Reprint</i></span></h2>
<p>It had been our original intention to devote a page in each issue on
how to detect reprints of popular historic newspapers. But so many
