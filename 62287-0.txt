                 Amateur Journalists Who Became Famous


In “The Career and Reminiscences of an Amateur Journalist,” Thos. G.
Harrison states that Nathaniel Hawthorne was really a pioneer member of
the clan, having gotten out six weekly issues of a periodical of this
description, called THE SPECTATOR, the first number appearing Aug. 21,
1820. Thus it predates by three years what many have heretofore accepted
as his first literary effort, in the SALEM GAZETTE, in 1823.

Prior to its appearance, Hawthorne, at that time a youth of 16, got out
a preliminary prospectus, stating that THE SPECTATOR would be issued on
Wednesdays, at 12c per annum, payment to be made at the end of the year.
In an early issue, Hawthorne advertised that he proposed to publish by
subscription, a new edition of “The Miseries of Authors,” to which he
promised to add a sequel containing facts and remarks drawn from his own
experience.

Truman J. Spencer, for many years a historian on amateur journalism,
questions whether a copy of either THE SPECTATOR or Hawthorne’s
prospectus, is in existence today. Here, then, is an opportunity for
ambitious bibliophiles and rare book speculators to ransack the garrets
of their ancestors, and “see what they can see.” Harrison states that
THE SPECTATOR was neatly written by the hand of Hawthorne. It was
probably manifolded by some crude reproducing process of that period.

                        TO THE JUVENILE PUBLIC.

The title to address the public, when a periodical work is first offered
for patronage, is established by custom, and a deviation from the
general usage, would be a breach of decorum, since the public now
demands, as a right, what formerly it granted as a courtesy; and, of
late years, more labour is bestowed in writing these “_Repositories of
promises_,” than in vamping up the original work. As it seems required,
therefore of every candidate, that he should publicly declare his
pretensions to favour, the Editor, in compliance with the general
custom, deems it necessary, briefly to state the intention of the
present work; and, in this, as well as in his Editorial capacity, in
general, he respectfully solicits from his patrons, that indulgence,
which the inexperience of youth so amply requires. In order, therefore,
to make up for his own deficiency, he respectfully solicits the favour
and assistance of such of the “_Literary Youth_,” as may have time and
inclination, to favour him with their communications. He has, also, the
promise of a few gentlemen of polite taste, to condescend their aid, “to
diffuse elegant and instructive literature, to soothe trembling merit,
and to ROUSE AND FOSTER INFANT GENIUS.”

The columns of the Juvenile Port-Folio, will consist of all the _variety
of subject_, and Miscellaneous literature, which Magazines, and other
periodical literary works, usually contain: Selected with particular
attention to those subjects, that are adapted to the improvement,
edification, and rational amusement of youth. In our searches after
variety, a preference will always be given to those pieces, which are
characterised by elegance of expression, chastity of thought, and value
of information. “Though we shall touch, like the Bee, upon every plant
in the garden of literature, we shall only extract from those which
produce sweets, and diffuse fragrance.”

Besides the more general subjects of literature, its pages will always
be open to such extracts of popular interest, as may be judicious and
entertaining; also a general selection of rare anecdotes, points of wit,
brilliant repartee, &c. Our purpose will be to render this department,
lively without licentiousness, brilliant without tinsel, and elegant
without elaboration.

In the region of the Muses, we particularly solicit aid, but we fear
“not from the voice of inspiration.” We may venture, however, to hope,
that the perusal of our selected poetry will excite emulation, as no
piece will be admitted, which cannot lay some claim to true genius and
poetical merit.

The Ladies will receive the Juvenile Port-Folio as an entertaining
companion, studious of their favour, by courtly manners and valuable
information; and the Gentlemen will find in it, a manly and correct
conduct, which we hope will not be unworthy of their regard; as, we
shall ever be anxious to please the Polite, the Learned, the Witty and
the Fair, with those views, we are emboldened to ask the patronage of
the public.

  “And, confident of praise, IF PRAISE BE DUE,
  Trust without fear, to merit and to You.”

But Hawthorne was not the first to publish a “boys’ paper.” From a
pamphlet on “Amateur Journalism,” issued by Will G. Snow of Meriden,
Conn., to commemorate “An Association of Amateur Journalists of the
Past,” called “The Fossils,” we learn that the earliest known American
example is THE JUVENILE PORTFOLIO AND LITERARY MISCELLANY, an eight-page
weekly, published from Oct. 17, 1812 to Dec. 7, 1816 by Thomas G.
Condie, Jr., at 22 Carter’s Alley, opposite Stephen Girard’s Bank,
Philadelphia, as per illustration herewith.

After the demise of Hawthorne’s periodical, amateur journalism seemingly
went into a slumber twice as long as the famed sleep of Rip Van Winkle.
However, in 1858, came the COOS HERALD of Lancaster, N. H., and by 1872,
approximately 200 amateur gazettes were being turned out. At this period
the juvenile journal considered as having the largest circulation, was
OUR BOYS, started in Chicago in 1871 as a “four-pager,” and which by
1873 had evolved into a 16-page periodical almost as large as HARPER’S
WEEKLY. In its prime it is said to have enjoyed a circulation of 10,000
copies per issue. Most of these sheets varied in size from 4 pages of 3
by 4 inch dimensions to 32 pages, measuring 10 by 12, the latter about
the width of four ordinary newspaper columns. The average life of an
amateur paper was estimated at 8 months, which period was ample to
disgust most youthful journalists with the hardships of an editorial
career.

In 1869, it was deemed advisable to organize an association for mutual
acquaintance, social intercourse and to assist the cause of amateur
journalism throughout the United States. A meeting was held in New York
at the residence of Charles Scribner, from which evolved the National
Amateur Press Association. Nellie Williams, a 13-year miss, is credited
as being the first “female of the species.” She issued the PENFIELD
EXTRA soon after the commencement of the Civil War. It had been planned
to issue an amateur journal at the Centennial Exposition of 1876, and it
was said that $5000 could have been raised without difficulty for that
purpose, but Director General Goshorn would not allot space, claiming
that the word “amateur” savored of infancy of mind.

When approximately half a century ago, George Harrison announced himself
as a candidate for the presidency of the Western Amateur Press
Association, his ambition did not meet with unanimous endorsement, if we
consider the following outburst from a rival sheet:

  “We smelt the smell of a dead rat when we received a copy of the
  WELCOME VISITOR, stating that Harrison is a candidate for the position
  of President of the Western Amateur Press Association, against Wyn
  Morris. We can inform the gentleman from Indiana that he is on the
  hull of a sinking ship, and when he grasps for the exalted position he
  has in view, it will melt before his eyes, and he will gradually sink
  into the waters of oblivion. George, dear George, you are left
  sure.”—AMATEUR IOWAN.

To this not over-delicate prognostication, the Harrison clan replied in
kind as set forth below:

  “THE IOWAN no doubt smelt its own smell, eh. As for Harrison being
  left in the race, we beg to inform our IOWA contemporary, in all
  probability it is entirely mistaken. No other candidate now in the
  field has a better chance than he.”—The WELCOME VISITOR.

Let us quote one more expression of opinion, as one contempt-orary to
another:

  “In our estimation nothing is so contemptible as to publish an article
  against an individual and then refuse to send him a copy of the paper
  containing the attack. The low-lived editors of the YOUNG DEMOCRAT
  should paste this in their hats.”—THE ACORN, St. Louis.

At the time Mr. Snow wrote his “Amateur Journalism” pamphlet, in 1922,
the Fossil Library, consisting of 50,000 old amateur papers, was located
at 150 Nassau St., New York. It has since been moved to the Franklin
Memorial Institute, Philadelphia, where it will be permanently preserved
under the care of the Curtis Family of SATURDAY EVENING POST fame. The
second largest collection is owned by Truman J. Spencer, of Hamden,
Conn., while Vincent B. Haggery of Jersey City, N. J., has one of the
very few known files of the official organ of the National Amateur Press
Association, embracing 63 years. Any one interested can obtain
information as to other fine collections by writing to Edwin H. Smith,
Librarian of the N.A.P.A., 524 N. Kenmore St., Philadelphia.

As to amateur journalists who subsequently reached exalted ranks as
authors or publishers, Mr. Spencer has kindly furnished me with the
following list:

FRANK B. NOYES, publisher Washington STAR, at age of 12 ran the TIMES.

THEODORE BODENWEIN (recently deceased), publisher of the New London DAY,
at 17 ran the THAMES BUDGET.

E. H. STAIR, owner Detroit FREE PRESS, ran OUR BOYS AND GIRLS, in 1873.

JOSEPHUS DANIELS, publisher of the Raleigh NEWS AND OBSERVER, and
ex-Secretary of the Navy, at age of 12 ran the CORNUCOPIA.

RICHARD W. GILDER, for many years editor of the CENTURY MAGAZINE, ran
the REGISTER at 16.

CYRUS H. K. CURTIS, S. E. POST AND LADIES’ HOME JOURNAL publisher,
conducted YOUNG AMERICA at the age of 14.

JOHN THAYER, well-remembered as publisher of EVERYBODY’S MAGAZINE and
the SMART SET, when only 13, ran the PRINTER.

GEORGE B. M. HARVEY, one of the final publishers of HARPER’S WEEKLY,
issued the DEMOCRAT when only 14.

There were many other eminent publishers that lack of space compels us
to omit. And as for authors who became famous, Robert Louis Stevenson
issued the SUNBEAM MAGAZINE when 16; Frank Baum who wrote “The Wizard of
Oz” published the HOME JOURNAL in 1868; and Walter Pritchard, New York
theatre critic, and author of numerous books on the drama, joined the
amateur ranks at 12.

According to Mr. Spencer, amateur journalism still exists and continues
to hold a fascination for many youths of today. From the speculative
standpoint, however, there is at present no active demand for an oldtime
collection thereof, although probably some individual with an ample
purse and a nostalgia for youth, would be happy to possess one, and pay
well for it. But who and where he is, it will take a wiser person than
the editor of this publication, to identify.

Collectors of this interesting phase of Americana, will look forward
with pleasurable anticipation to the publication of a book entitled
“History of Amateur Journalism,” on which Truman J. Spencer has been
working for years. The outline of contents will comprise, DEFINITION AND
DESCRIPTION ... THE PIONEERS ... EXCHANGING AND ORGANIZING ... THE
NATIONAL AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION ... RIVAL ORGANIZATIONS ... SECTIONAL
AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS ... LITERATURE AND BOOKS ... THE FOSSILS ...
APPENDIX. Full information as to the date of publication, price, etc.,
can be obtained by writing to Truman J. Spencer, 2525 Whitney Ave.,
Hamden, Conn.


The famous rooming house at 61 Washington Square, N. Y., conducted for
more than fifty years by Mme. Katherine Branchard, and since her decease
in 1937, by her daughter-in-law, is no more. During their years of
struggle it was a haven of repose for Willa Cather, Frank Norris, Gelett
Burgess, Theodore Dreiser and Adelina Patti. After their departure from
the Branchard House, which incidentally is over 100 years old, they
wrote her letters from all parts of the world, and these should produce
some good autographic material.

Mrs. Adelaide M. Faron, of the Walt Whitman Society of America, and
Librarian of the Hempstead Library, Hempstead, Long Island, N. Y.,
recently held at the Adelphia College, Garden City, N. Y., an exhibition
of rare items and newly discovered manuscripts pertaining to the “good
gray poet”.

Here is a little good advice from that past master of sheet music
knowledge, Wm. McDevitt, 2079 Sutter St., San Francisco. In his very
entertaining monthly called BOOK-COLLECTING (50 cents a year) he
says:—“In buying first editions of old songs, you will be safer in most
cases if the sheet music doesn’t contain ads on the back cover; you will
generally do well to distrust copies with the copyright line on front
apparently worn out with repeated printings.”

                     Good Investments In Autographs


       _Written for_ The Collector’s Guide _by Mary A. Benjamin_

    [Illustration:                                  _Allied News-Photo_]

Frequently I am asked, “What is a safe investment in autographic
material over a long period of years?” The answer may well come from my
experience gained in this field during the past decade. The boom years
of 1928 and 1929 sent many items of a literary, historical and musical
character sky-rocketing, although subsequently they shot down just as
suddenly, 1938 seeing prices at probably their lowest level in 25 years.
And yet, just as in the case of rare books, some forms of autograph
material suffered less than others. The knowledge thus gained, helps
materially to light the pathway as to what is the best sort of
autographic material to consider for future investment.

Today, the safest buy seems to be good Presidential letters written
either before or during their terms of office, preferably the latter.
These letters must have worthwhile contents. Uninteresting documents of
our Chief Executives are all too common and sell at nominal figures.
Signers of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution are
also excellent, that is, if the contents measure up. In the literary
domain, authors’ letters about their works are always sought for,
although prices are more inclined to fluctuate than on historical items.

Of late, increased interest has been evinced in the “War between the
States,” or, as it is called up North, the Civil War. An added lure is
that prices for this sort of material, are almost at rock-bottom, as
collectors are just beginning to wake up to its importance. The years
will see good war letters of famous Federal and Confederate Generals go
very high. The upward swing has already begun.

A new field which has sprung up recently is that of State collections.
The country has heretofore been too young to care much for the
historical records of individual localities. But with the development of
the nation, this interest has steadily grown, and today, all letters
relating to internal politics of individual states or cities are being
sought, the competition having a healthy effect upon prices.

Early Mormon material, and records pertaining to Texas, Michigan,
Colorado, Virginia, California, etc., are in active demand, thus
enabling the average dealer to place them without difficulty almost as
fast as received. Furthermore, whereas a collector may become
discouraged in buying a complete set of Signers because of the
super-rarity of a few names, there is little difficulty in obtaining the
two or three Signers belonging to the collector’s home state, to say
nothing of famous Generals, literary lights, composers, etc.

The one, almost unchanging code of the collector should be to buy
hand-written letters of good date, and of unusual, historical, or
otherwise excellent content. Fine items seem to hold their value pretty
well, even in times of financial stress, and with the years should edge
upwards in price. Less desirable items will fluctuate considerably. To
sum up, good autographs provide the best expectation for at least a fair
dividend on the money invested. On the other hand, common items that
have little to recommend them except cheapness, are almost invariably a
disappointment as far as the hope of satisfactory returns, are
concerned. There are occasional exceptions but this rule holds true 98%
of the time. In closing, may I also stress the importance of being sure
that what you purchase is genuine. Unless you are an expert yourself,
the safest way is to acquire your pen treasures only through a dealer on
whose reliability and experience you can absolutely depend.


Walter Hart Blumenthal, rare book specialist at 1775 Broadway, New York,
is frequently called upon to contribute articles on odd books, such as
for example a Shorthand Bible, a Latin Life of Washington, “Alice in
Wonderland” in Esperanto, and a book bound in human skin. Shortly THE
COLOPHON will present an article by Mr. Blumenthal on books in which the
text and illustrations are pierced into the vellum, letter by letter,
the pages being backed by colored silk. In all the world, only seven
such early volumes are known, he states.

                       _A Book Stamp Innovation_


    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

As Flodden W. Heron aptly observed in a recent issue of the ARGONAUT, it
is estimated by the Postal Department that one person out of every
fifteen is interested in stamp collecting. There are over twenty-five
journals issued exclusively for stamp collectors, and three hundred and
two American newspapers maintain stamp departments. In addition
sixty-four radio stations conduct regular stamp broadcasts. Book
collectors constitute a much smaller group, and to date there has been
no connection between these two enthusiastic armies of “acquisitioners.”
To bring these two groups into closer cooperation, Mr. Heron recently
suggested to the Pacific Philatelic Society of San Francisco the use of
postage stamps of authors as association items for collected books.
Investigation disclosed that postage stamps had been issued in honor of
nearly one hundred authors.

He states that the idea occurred to him when coming into possession of a
Stamp Case, invented by Lewis Carroll of “Alice in Wonderland” fame. It
contained twelve pockets for stamps of different denominations.
Progressively this gave birth to the thought of using stamps as
association items in connection with first editions, artistically
affixing them to fly-leaves, inside covers, or occasionally to title
pages. Time will increase the scarcity or rarity of the stamps, and in
some instances, as with certain bookplates, greatly enhance the value of
the books to which they are affixed. Of course we must bear in mind that
the number who collect stamps exceeds greatly those whose interest is in
rare books. At the same time, many high school and college students and
other groups, would like to collect books but cannot afford the prices
of first editions. However, if postage stamps are classified as
association items, thousands can buy books not first editions, but good
reading copies. The inserting of proper stamps, will permit of book
collecting on an inexpensive scale, because it is only necessary to
watch dates, and acquire first-day “covers” for merely the regular price
of the stamps. And as time goes on, these first issues will have
increased value for book insertion, quite aside from their desirability
to stamp collectors. For example, a copy of “Leaves of Grass,” issued by
the Modern Library, with a first-day Whitman “cover” laid in, should
fetch over double the cost of the book within a year after the stamp was
issued. And this, in spite of the fact that a postage stamp in
connection with a book can not be compared with an author’s inscription
or presentation. It can be more likened to a bookplate, which has been
added to the volume by some one other than the author. Two of Mr.
Heron’s favorite authors are Lewis Carroll and Sir Walter Scott, and as
he could find of them no existing postage stamps, he had two made, for
his personal use, which serve as illustrations for this article. We feel
certain that Mr. Heron will be glad to answer any question pertaining to
book stamps on the part of those interested, if they will address their
inquiries to him at Mills Building, San Francisco.


Temple Scott, rare book expert, died on Sept. 30th. in Edinburgh. Among
his many activities, he had been adviser in the assembling of some of
the notable private libraries of this country, including those of Jerome
Kern, and the late William H. Woodin, former Secretary of the Treasury.
The Kern collection was considered one of the most valuable ever gotten
together in America, and in 1929 was sold at auction for $1,300,000.
Also remembered are some of Mr. Scott’s outstanding purchases including
the letters of Lord Chesterfield for which he paid $75,000, and the
original text which Sir Walter Scott prepared for a definitive edition
of his novels, and which set him back $150,000.

The first volume of Dr. Greg’s “Bibliography of the English Drama to
1640” is reported as ready. Information regarding it can be obtained
from R. B. McKerrow, Picket Place, Wendover, Bucks, England.

Mrs. Nellie Dumont, widow of the minstrel king, Frank Dumont, died
several months ago at her home, 1207 Green St., Philadelphia, Penna.,
where she had resided for 60 years. Mr. Dumont in his lifetime,
possessed an unusually fine collection of theatrical material, and to
this day, as far as we know, it has never been definitely established,
just what became of it.

When the date of the publication is not in brackets, it means that the
same will be found on title page. When, however, it is in brackets,
thus, (1931), it indicates that said date is printed either on the
reverse side of title page, or in some other part of the book. Or,
possibly, the date does not appear at all, in which case the brackets
are merely authoritative information supplied by the bibliographer.
Furthermore, our endeavor has been to list only authors and books for
which there is a reasonably active present-day demand, and which have a
speculative future.

                              Stick ’Em Up


As a preface to “Books on Western Gunmen,” by Guy J. Giffen, in the
Quarterly NEWS-LETTER of the Book Club of California, an editorial note
states that not the least interesting subdivision of Americana is that
relating to the bandits and gunmen of the Old West. The extensive
literature on the subject offers a tempting field to collectors with a
taste for the history and legend surrounding this phase of the Winning
of the West. Mr. Giffen’s extensive library of books on Western outlaws
is the result of a hobby of years’ standing.

Mr. Giffen’s article maintains that any well-rounded collection of
Western Americana should have a division of books on gunmen, and
mentions a number of men and titles that will serve as a general guide
to their selection. Of particular interest are the books on Murrieta.
“Joaquin Murrieta, the Brigand Chief of California” was published by the
CALIFORNIA POLICE GAZETTE in 1854, and is now very rare, only two copies
being known, both in private collections. According to Franklin Walker
as set forth in “San Francisco’s Literary Frontier,” John Rollin Ridge,
partly of Indian blood, who came to San Francisco in 1850, furnished the
GAZETTE with much of its source material when he wrote “The Life and
Adventures of Joaquin Murrieta, the Celebrated California Bandit.” In
1859, the GAZETTE reprinted the story with additions but also in this
instance, only two copies are known to have survived. Of the many later
treatments of Murrieta, one of the best is “The Life and Adventures of
the Celebrated Bandit Joaquin Murrieta,” translated from the Spanish of
Ireno Paz, by Frances P. Belle. (Chicago, 1925).

This is a readable account of his exploits, but it credits him with
superhuman ability, and relates incidents that could not have happened.
In Mr. Giffen’s belief, Murrieta’s true history has not yet been told
and at this late date, it is unlikely that it ever will be. It may be
interesting to collectors of Murrietana, to note that in 1880, a play
was produced at the Adelphi Variety Theatre, San Francisco, purporting
to picture the life of Murrieta. It was called “The Scarlet IX.”

Stories of two California bandits of a much later date, Evans and
Sontag, are related in “The 25th Man”, published in 1924. The author, Ed
Morrell, gives a readable account of his experiences with these outlaws,
bearing however a bit heavily on the first person. The exploits of Evans
and Sontag were also offered to the public in dramatic form, at the
National Theatre, San Francisco, in the early nineties, some of the
bandit’s children having been engaged as a sort of “added attraction.”

C. B. Glasscock’s “Bandits and the Southern Pacific” (New York, 1929) is
also an interesting narrative. “Old Waybills”, by Alvin F. Harlow (New
York, 1934) while primarily concerned with the pioneer express
companies, gives entertaining accounts of Black Bart, Jesse and Frank
James, Sam Bass and the Daltons, and indicates a sincere effort to
gather the facts. The books of Owen P. White have added much to
present-day popular knowledge of the outstanding killers and peace
officers of the Old West. His “Them Was the Days” (New York, 1925),
“Trigger Fingers” (New York, 1926), and “Lead and Likker” (New York,
1932) make exciting reading and present a true picture so far as the
truth can now be known. “Triggernometry” by Eugene Cunningham (New York,
1935) is another sincere endeavor to treat the gunmen as human beings
rather than supermen.

Returning to books about individual bandits, one of the best is “Wild
Bill Hickok—Prince of Pistoleers”, by Frank J. Wilstach (New York,
1928), this work also containing many illustrations of more than passing
interest. “Wild Bill” (James Butler) Hickok has been much written about.
Probably the best account of his connection with the famous McCanlas
affair was published in the NEBRASKA HISTORY MAGAZINE for April-June,
1927. In it, the story of Colonel Nichols, published previously in
HARPER’S MAGAZINE of February, 1867 (and copied practically by every
biographer of Hickok) is disproved.

Of nineteen volumes dealing with the James gang, “The Rise and Fall of
Jesse James,” by Robertus Love (New York, 1925) seems the most thorough
and unbiased biography. An important and scarce James item is “The Trial
of Frank James for Murder,” by George Miller, Jr., privately printed in
Missouri in 1898. It gives in detail information not to be found
elsewhere. The list could go on indefinitely, for the period of the
gunmen extended from the Civil War to the middle 90’s, and the
literature on the subject is limitless. Much of it, of course, is lurid,
sensational material, written solely for entertainment and with no claim
to historical accuracy. But there are also many more pretentious works:
good, bad and indifferent. Many otherwise excellent biographies of
Western gunmen are marred by the fact that the author’s treatment is

that is a failing of biographers in general.

                               INCUNABULA


In a recent article in the New York TIMES, Philip Brooks, noted rare
book commentator, remarked that there is nothing particularly mysterious
about incunabula. A polysyllabic Latin word with an impressive sound, it
means simply cradle books, or books published during the infancy of
printing. They occupy only a short span in the history of books, no more
than about fifty years, from the middle to the end of the fifteenth
century. To many collectors they are the true aristocrats, not only for
their antiquity, but often for their artistic beauty. For nearly 500
years printers have been trying but none have been able to approach the
typographical perfection of the Gutenberg Bible, which was finished
around 1455. Even the paper of these ancients is of superior quality
that they will outlive most books issued today.

Mr. Brooks further declared that while a common objection to collecting
incunabula is that they are incomprehensible, being printed in dead
languages that nobody reads nowadays, it is nevertheless a fact that
before the end of the century, books were being published freely in the
vernacular, and Caxton and his successors were making valuable
contributions to English literature in their native tongue.

Since the middle of the seventeenth century, when the output of the
fifteenth century first began to attract notice as collectible objects,
they have been subject to such intensive scrutiny that they are now the
most thoroughly bibliographed books in the world. From Panzer
(1793-1803) and Hain (1826-1834), who described 16,300 titles, the
scientific study evolved through the brilliant work of Bradshaw and
Proctor until its culmination in the British Museum catalogue.

Moreover, collectors today who look somewhat wistfully on the mounting
prices of fifteenth century editiones principes (which means first
editions) of Gutenberg Bibles even in single leaves, or of that familiar
favorite, the Nuremberg Chronicle, are probably unaware that many
incunabula are still available for much less than $100. The elusiveness
and high price of all incunabula are as much a fiction as the belief
that it is impossible to identify individual volumes.

It is generally admitted that there are in existence some 40,000
separate editions of books published during the fifteenth century. No
one has yet had the hardihood to attempt to count all the known copies
of these editions. One of the best modern efforts to gauge their extent
was that of K. W. Hiersemann in his “Verlagskatalog”, Leipzig, 1924. He
estimated that there were at least 450,000 pieces of incunabula around,
or an average of more than eleven copies of each known edition.

In undertaking to investigate the present-day holdings of incunabula in
all countries, Fremont Rider, librarian of the Olin Library at Wesleyan
University, reported that Germany, the birthplace of printing and native
home of most incunabula, is still, according to the latest available
records, the largest holder of such books. With 105 libraries owning a
hundred volumes or more, it registers a total of 115,927 volumes. Italy
ranks second with 70,721. France makes a poor third with 35,278, just
nosing out Great Britain’s 34,045. Austria comes next, outranking the
United States, which can muster 22,166 volumes. Poland, Switzerland,
Czecho-Slovakia, Spain, Holland and Russia follow next in order. In the
25 countries listed with libraries of a hundred or more volumes, Mr.
Rider has located 380,750 titles.

The outstanding single collection of incunabula is in the Bayerische
Staatsbibliothek at Munich, with its 16,000 volumes. The British Museum
comes second with 11,500, the Bibliotheque Nationale third with 10,000.
The Huntington Library’s 5,200 take sixth place, while the 3,600 in the
Library of Congress entitle it to rank seventeenth among the libraries
of the world. Despite the great influx of incunabula into this country
in recent years, the resources of the European collections are
incomparable. It is perfectly true that most American libraries regard
the acquisition of a single incunabulum as a rare treasure, while many
unheard-of European libraries of religious orders or princely families
own far more volumes than our largest and richest universities.

Mr. Rider’s analysis makes no attempt to assay the contents of the
various collections, as his concern is only with a quantitative
analysis. Some of the scarcest and most important incunables have found
their way into this country. As a result of an inquiry among the 236
most likely sources in the United States, a table is shown giving the
relative sizes of incunabula collections in twelve institutions and over
a hundred colleges and universities. Following the Huntington and the
Library of Congress are Harvard University with 1,860 volumes, the
Pierpont Morgan Library with 1,800 and the Newberry Library with 1,634.
The Folger Shakespeare Library contains a surprisingly large
Shakespearean ancestry of 250 fifteenth century sources. The summary
leaves out of account the growing private collections, confined mostly
to this country, whose numbers should materially affect the figures and
perhaps the order of rank. Otherwise it gives a satisfactory account of
the distribution of incunabula in public institutions.




                     Collecting Medical Literature


                    _An Interview With An Authority_

Hello, Henry Schuman.

Hello, James Madison.

Since moving from Detroit to 730 Fifth Avenue, New York, are you
continuing to make a specialty of medical rarities?

Yes indeed, in fact more so than ever.

What class of collectors go in for medical books?

Mostly members of the medical profession, but also general collectors
along scientific lines of which medicine is an integral part.

Do collectors of medical literature aim to cover the entire field?

Not in most instances. They usually specialize in branches that
encompass their special interests, such for example as physiognomy,
transfusion of blood, heart disorders, venereal ailments, etc.

Has a well-selected medical library that was already assembled at say
the turn of the century, increased or diminished in value?

Increased I should say, or, from a very conservative estimate, at least
held its own. This is due, no doubt, to the permanent interest such a
medical library holds. On the other hand, authors of literary classics,
especially from the beginning of the 19th century on, are subject to
increasing or waning interest due to a change of popular favor and
appreciation. In the case of modern authors such as Hemingway, Faulkner,
etc., this is even more noticeable. The “white-headed” literary lion of
today may be on tomorrow’s bargain shelf, and vice versa.

Is the number of collectors of medical literature increasing?

Somewhat, I should say. In the late twenties, Dr. Henry E. Sigerist
became head of the Institute of Medicine at John Hopkins University
where his outstanding accomplishments, combined also with his splendid
achievement in promoting the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, did
much to stimulate new interest, especially among the younger men.

Which is the best medical bibliography?

Probably the best, and certainly the most concise is Garrison’s “History
of Medicine”, first published in 1914 by W. B. Saunders Co.,
Philadelphia. The fourth edition was issued in 1929 and is revised and
comparatively up to date. It sells for $14.

How can one get posted on the prices of medical literature?

The Sanders Price List of Medica Incunabula gives some prices of early
medicine. The cost is $10. As far as more modern medical books and
miscellany are concerned, I believe the best guide is dealers’ lists who
specialize in this sort of thing. I myself get out occasional catalogues
of medical rarities, my latest one being issued to honor the seventieth
birthday of Dr. Harvey Cushing, who is since deceased.

How do you procure the medical material that you resell?

There is no royal path that a dealer can pursue. One source is medical
libraries privately owned, and which on the decease of the owner, have
come into the possession of heirs who have no special interest therein,
and who therefore are not adverse to turning them into ready cash.
Europe, which may be termed the cradle of old medicine, holds most of
the rarities, especially those of ancient vintage, and my correspondents
on the other side are constantly on the watch for me.

How highly are medical periodicals regarded by collectors?

They play, as a rule, ‘second fiddle’ to books and pamphlets. They are
quite bulky, and in harmony with the modern scheme of architectural
contraction, collectors are not inclined to grant them shelf room. The
best modern outlet for medical periodicals appears to be colleges and
universities, although in many instances, the seller pro tem is apt to
be met with the rubber-stamp response of “Insufficient funds.”

Have many facsimile reproductions been made of rare medical books and
pamphlets?

Only a negligible number thus far and which have sold rather
indifferently. However, with the increasing interest displayed in the
collecting of medical literature, facsimiles will come more and more
into their own.

Are many medical works sold at book auctions?

Hardly any, I should say. Medical books at best interest but a modest
pro rata of collectors. Therefore, except in occasional instances, it
has not been found profitable to include them in auction catalogues.

Who are the modern American trail blazers as far as stimulating interest
in the collecting of medical literature is concerned?

In my opinion, Drs. Oliver Wendell Holmes, William Osler, and Harvey
Cushing.




                       _A New Aid to Collectors_


Early in the year, the Pinwheel Press, of 142 So. 11th St.,
Philadelphia, will publish “Early American Sheet Music” by Harry
Dichter. This is probably the first attempt to aid collectors and
dealers in this fascinating field of Americana. It will be illustrated
with many full-page reproductions of esteemed sheet music covers and
also give much useful bibliographical information. A business
announcement in this issue, gives full information as to its cost in the
several editions.




                      _About The New York Mirror_


In 1823, George P. Morris in conjunction with Samuel Woodworth
established the New York MIRROR. In those days Woodworth was considered
quite a poet, his most permanent obeisance to the muse being “The
Bucket”, later more fittingly known as “The Old Oaken Bucket”. The
MIRROR lasted until 1842, but returned from its journalistic grave the
year following and was known as the NEW MIRROR. It ran for a year and a
half and stated in its last issue in Sept., 1844, that it was being
discontinued because the Post Office charged it magazine postage which
was much higher than that required of newspapers. Perhaps, to avail
itself of this discrimination, it became a daily about this time, a
weekly edition being gotten out for the benefit of the former NEW MIRROR
subscribers. From Sept., 1844 to February, 1845, Edgar Allan Poe, so the
“Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America” reports, was employed
as critical writer. Perhaps this explains why “The Raven” was printed in
the EVENING MIRROR, on Jan. 29, 1845, “by permission”, from the advance
sheets of the AMERICAN REVIEW where it appeared a few weeks later. While
the MIRROR copy is usually spoken of as the second appearance of “The
Raven”, most collectors prefer it to its AMERICAN REVIEW appearance and
it commands a higher price, although in neither case as much as one
might conjecture.

After Willis and Morris withdrew in 1845, Hiram Fuller took charge and
with certain minor changes of title, the periodical continued until
1857. Soon after Fuller came into control, he was sued by Poe for having
published the Thomas Dunn English article reflecting on his character.
Poe was awarded $225 damages.

                          _Suckers’ Progress_


A book jobber recently found on his hands an entire warehouse full of
obsolete histories in sets of 20 volumes each. They simply wouldn’t
sell; nobody wanted to give them away as premiums; their stock was so
inferior that secondhand paper dealers laughed at the idea of purchasing
them. Then inspiration came to the jobber. He expressed the entire
edition to a publisher’s sucker list, accompanied by the following
letter.

  Sir:

  We are forwarding you herewith a set of Professor McFeely’s _History
  of the World From Earliest Times Down to the Inaugural of Chester A.
  Arthur_. There are two bindings available: one in cloth such as we are
  sending you, retailing for $19.25, the other in beautiful hand-tooled
  crushed levant, for $39.98. If you should decide you prefer the
  expensive leather-bound edition you may return the set we are sending
  you and upon remitting the balance you will receive the other
  magnificent volumes.

Each sucker actually received the leather-bound edition—in fact, no
cloth one existed. But every recipient, imagining that he had received
the wrong books by mistake and was gypping the jobber, sent on his
$19.25 and kept the books. In no time the entire edition was sold out.

DIGEST).


The New York TIMES reports that a new Medical Library building is being
erected at the Yale University of Medicine to receive Dr. Cushing’s
library and collections, including his letters, diaries and manuscripts.
Any of his friends who wish, now or later, to present correspondence,
photographs or other memorabilia for permanent preservation among the
Cushing papers will receive the appreciative thanks of the university.

The late Merle Johnson, in his “American First Editions” called
attention to the fact that there is no formal Bibliography of the
writings of Bret Harte. The collector is referred to the sales catalogue
of the Charles Meeker Kozlay sale, held at the galleries of the American
Art Association some years ago and now on file at the New York Public
Library. It is the only known listing of the variants and minutiae.

In “San Francisco’s Literary Frontiers”, by Franklin Walker, “The Annals
of San Francisco” is described as being probably the best book ever
written about that glamorous city. Its 800 pages give not only the
history of California during the Spanish and American occupations, but
also a faithful account of its social history from 1846 to 1854.
Included also are vigorously penned descriptions of special local
happenings, such as the Great Fires, Steamer Days, the lawless ravages
of The “Hounds”, etc, to say nothing of short biographies of outstanding
oldtimers. The “Annals” have long been out of print, but the book was
gotten up so sumptuously that many copies were kept. It can usually be
picked up for from $7.50 to $20.00 depending on the condition and
binding. A folding map should accompany it. A few years ago, the
California Historical Society, San Francisco, compiled, under the
direction of Charles Francis Griffin, a 28 page index, which is a big
time-saver for historians, and literary searchers. It is bound in full
paper boards, and is sold by the Society for $1.25.

Bookplate collectors who desire to know what collections have been
assembled, where they are, the type of material gathered, how they are
cared for, and their availability for study and consultation, should
procure a copy of “A Census of Bookplate Collections in Public, College
and University Libraries.” It was compiled by Carlyle S. Baer, presiding
genius of the American Society of Bookplate Collectors & Designers, and
Miss Clara Therese Evans, of Columbia University. The cost is $1.00 and
it can be obtained by writing to Mr. Baer at 1763 Euclid St., N.W.,
Washington, D. C.


Robert L. Shurter presents in the July, 1939, issue of the SOUTH
ATLANTIC QUARTERLY, an article on “The Writing of Looking Backward”, in
which the facts regarding the composition, purpose, and subsequent
influences of Edward Bellamy’s novel are set forth.

We understand that a committee of bibliographers headed by Lawrence C.
Wroth, librarian of the John Carter Brown Library, Providence, is making
plans for the compilation and publication of a “Cooperative Catalogue of
Americana, 1700-1800”, and will be based upon material now housed in the
principal libraries of this country. It will contain all eighteenth
century historical material relating to the Western hemisphere, except
newspapers, broadsides, maps, prints, almanacs, legislative and
administrative proceedings and statute laws. A preliminary survey has
disclosed that only about half of the existing material is recorded in
either Sabin or Evans.

You can’t possibly get in touch with all the rare book, autograph and

“Twenty-Three Books, and the Stories Behind Them” is the title of John
T. Winterich’s latest volume, and conveys in its title but meagerly the
feast in store for those who wish to get a new slant on a number of the
world’s most famous books and the literary geniuses who wrote them. Not
only has Mr. Winterich an almost unique research aptitude, but also the
magnetic quality of being able to marshal his facts in a sprightly
manner. Aside from this, the book has additionally, a fund of definite
information for collectors, respecting the rarity and speculative
possibilities of the many classics of literature that it deals with. It
is a handsomely bound, fully indexed volume of 241 pages and is
published by J. B. Lippincott & Co., at $2.50.

The United States Card Collectors’ Catalog will come as a boon to
gatherers of various sorts of cards, including tobacco, cigarette,
candy, gum, etc. Attention is also given to associated items of silk,
leather, and celluloid buttons, to say nothing of special sections
devoted to playing cards, post cards, name cards and other non-insert
types, tobacco albums, etc. “A pip,” “An admirable piece of research,”
“A remarkable feat” are a few expressions of opinion from those who
possess a copy. Over three years of preparation were required to compile
this 90-page volume. It sells for 50c, and is published by J. R.
Burdick, 417 South Crouse Ave., Syracuse, N. Y.

                          Prophets and Profits


Some volumes, for which the demand was indeed slender several
generations ago, are today the real prizes of literature. Take for
example the earlier pamphlets and books of Poe, which today are
virtually beyond the means of the average collector. But this
circumstance need not stifle collecting enthusiasm. There are other
volumes, which, while no longer cheap in terms of dollars and cents,
should nevertheless double or treble in value, or perhaps even better
than that, as time goes on. Of course it would be foolish to promise
this as a certainty, and we shall therefore content ourselves with
pointing out some “first edition nuggets” that seem to have an excellent
chance of “coming into the money” at some future period. But before
doing so, let us whisper in your ear, the desirability—we might almost
say the necessity—of only acquiring “firsts” in fine condition. Yes, we
know they’re hard to get, and also that they cost more, but in our
opinion, they’re well worth the difference. Auction records have
demonstrated this time and time again. And now, let us “amble beyond our
preamble,” and point out a few, present-day good buys.

Were we going into this branch of literary speculation, we should
endeavor to acquire the first edition, first issue of Walt Whitman’s
“Leaves of Grass,” and which was published in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1855.
No need to specify here all the necessary “points,” because, unless you
are a 100% bibliophile, you will probably do better acquiring this
treasure through some trustworthy and sophisticated rare book dealer. In
his worthy volume, “The Romance of Great Books and Their Authors,” John
T. Winterich quotes an assertion made by A. Edward Newton to the effect
that the first edition of the “Leaves of Grass” will reach a higher
figure than any other important book published in the nineteenth
century. When this declaration was made in 1924, asserts Mr. Winterich,
“Leaves of Grass” was selling in the market for $200 or less. Three
years later a copy was auctioned for $800, and in the interval since,
the price has risen, at auction and rare booksellers’ catalogues, to as
high as $3,000, with no indication that a summit of value has been
reached. The Chaucer Head Bookshop, of New York, recently offered a fine
copy without foxing for $1,000.

Another book with a definite speculative future is the first issue of
the first edition of Mark Twain’s first book, “The Celebrated Jumping
Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches”, with the original blue
cloth binding, and all the “points”. It was published in New York in
1867, and at the Effrem Zimbalist sale, held at the Parke-Bernet
Galleries on Nov. 15, an immaculate copy brought $610. Beadle, the daddy
of lurid American literature on a large scale, had previously published
in No. 3 of his “Dime Book of Fun” an abridged version of the “Frog”.
And if you should happen to run across a copy in good condition, there
should be no difficulty in collecting at least $200 therefore.

Or if pocket-book limitations do not justify “eating quite so high on
the hog”, we commend the issues of HARPER’S MAGAZINE from January to
August, 1894 inclusive. These contain the first printing of George Du
Maurier’s “Trilby”. It was later published in book form, but a picture
and a paragraph, which J. McNeil Whistler claimed lampooned him, were
omitted from the latter, although they had appeared in the magazine,
which explains why it is more sought after by collectors than the book.

Bound volumes of the Du Maurier HARPER’S without the covers are not
particularly scarce and hardly to be considered from the standpoint of a
speculative future. Therefore, endeavor to secure the unbound monthly
parts in good condition, and with the original wrappers. At the William
Harris Arnold sale in 1924, they brought $70.

                          _An Honest Heritage_


Thomas J. Condie, Jr., credited by Will Snow with being the earliest
known publisher of an American amateur periodical, came naturally by his
talents. According to Mott’s “History of American Magazines,” his father
Thomas Condie conducted at the tail end of the 18th century, the
PHILADELPHIA MONTHLY, which in 1798 had almost reached the thousand mark
in circulation. Incidentally on page 101 of Goodspeed’s very interesting
house-organ, THE MONTH, (December) appears an aquatint of Girard’s Bank
which is held at $35. The first article in this issue speaks of Condie,
Jr. having gotten out his JUVENILE PORTFOLIO AND LITERARY MISCELLANY at
22 Carter’s Alley, directly opposite and the acquatint apparently shows
the very building.




                        _How To Tell A Reprint_


It had been our original intention to devote a page in each issue on how
to detect reprints of popular historic newspapers. But so many items of
more general interest are clamoring for admittance to our columns, that
we are referring all inquiries to the Library of Congress, which has
gotten out 17 Information Circulars on the subject.
